# What is MASTODON?
MASTODON (Multi-hazard Analysis for STOchastic time-DOmaiN phenomena) is a <a href="http://mooseframework.org/"> MOOSE </a>-based application and performs finite-element
analysis of the dynamics of solids, mechanics of interfaces and porous
media flow. It is equipped with effective stress space nonlinear hysteretic soil constitutive  model (I-soil), and a <a href= "https://lwrs.inl.gov/RisckInformed%20Safety%20Margin%20Characterization/INL-EXT-15-36735%20Advanced%20Seismic%20Fragility%20Modeling.pdf"> u-p-U </a> formulation to couple solid and fluid, as well as structural materials such as reinforced concrete. It includes interface models that
simulate gapping, sliding and uplift at the interfaces of solid media
such as the foundation-soil interface of structures. Absorbing boundary models for the simulation of infinite or
semi-infinite domains, fault rupture model for seismic source
simulation, and the domain reduction method for the input of complex,
three-dimensional wave fields are incorporated. Since MASTODON is a <a href="http://mooseframework.org/"> MOOSE </a>-based application, it can efficiently solve problems using standard
workstations or very large high-performance computers.
