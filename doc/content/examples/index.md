# MASTODON examples

A list of example simulations using MASTODON is provided below. These examples include simple problems involving single-element simulations, as well as more complex simulations. To search for a particular example, please use the search bar above. The input files for each of these examples can be found in the [MASTODON GitHub repository](https://github.com/idaholab/mastodon). For simpler examples, users can also refer to the test files created for each object. These test files can also be found in the GitHub repository. For further assistance, users are welcome to [contact](/contact_us.md) the MASTODON team.
