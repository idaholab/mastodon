# Example 10b: Central Difference Time Integration in MASTODON using HEX20 elements

## Model Description
This example demonstrates the use of Central Difference Time Integration using HEX20 elements in MASTODON. A 2 feet x 2 feet x 20 feet cantilever is modelled with the bottom surface fixed along x, y & z directions. A uniform normal pressure of 1 kip/ft^2 is applied to the top surface along the axis of the model. The resulting stress time-history and displacement time-history are then obtained at locations (0, 0, 10) and (0, 0, 20) respectively and compared with results from ABAQUS/Standard (since HEX20 elements are unavailable in ABAQUS/Explicit).

[fig:ex10b_input] demonstrates the overall dimensions and boundary conditions of the model.

## Modelling in MASTODON

!listing examples/ex10b/MASTODON_Explicit_HEX20.i

The automeshing option provided by MASTODON is used to create the geometry and specify the element type (see documentation of [GeneratedMesh](syntax/index.md) in Syntax for detailed information).

         start=Mesh
         end=Variables

The displacement variables are defined in the `Variables` block. The accelerations, velocities and stresses are defined as auxiliary variables in the `AuxVariables` block. HEX20 elements use second order polynomials as shape functions and hence it is necessary to specify the `order=SECOND` for the displacements, accelerations and velocities. Stresses are specified to be of `order=FIRST` since they are one order lower than displacement.

The rest of the input file is identical to that of `Example10a`.

## Results
The stress time-history and displacement time-history are obtained at locations (0, 0, 10) and (0, 0, 20) respectively and compared with results from ABAQUS/Standard (as shown in [fig:ex10b_stresszz_0_0_10] and [fig:ex10b_Dispz_0_0_20]).
