## Getting Started

This section provides step-by-step instructions to define the basic components of a simple numerical model for a finite element analysis using MASTODON framework focusing on the geotechnical earthquake engineering applications.

### Defining a simple domain

The first thing necessary to run a finite element analysis is a meshed domain. Meshing the domain of interest for MASTODON finite element analysis can be achieved using the inbuilt mesh generator or using a preprocessor <a href= " https://cubit.sandia.gov/"> Cubit </a>. For any analysis, the number of dimensions and the degrees of freedom should be specified in the beginning of the input file. An example commands are provided below:

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=Mesh end=GlobalParams

This command generates a single brick element using the MASTODON mesh generator with 8 nodes, 8 gauss quadrature points, and unit length in each edge. dim = 3 command specifies that the domain in three dimensions, and nx, ny, and nz specify the number of elements in the corresponding directions.

\ref{fig:single_element} presents a generic three-dimensional brick element along with node and surface labels. Generated brick element is automatically assigned a block number (block 0 in this case) and each side of the brick is automatically assigned a surface number.


!media media/user/single_element.png width=60% margin-left=150px float=center id=fig:single_element caption=Single brick element (a) node labels (b) surface labels.

The next step is activating the global parameters. These are input parameters, which have the same value across the input file. The global parameters are activated providing the following commands:

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=GlobalParams end=Variables

By providing the above commands, the user specifies that if any object in the input file has a parameter called “displacements”, that parameter would be set to “disp_x disp_y disp_z”, which are the global displacement degrees of freedoms at the nodal points in x, y, and z directions, respectively.

Before or after (the sequence does not matter in the input file) the global parameters, the user has to specify the solution variables using the following commands:

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=Variables end=AuxVariables

MASTODON allows user to define auxiliary variables. Auxiliary variables are not solved for by the system but they are calculated from the solution variables. This is particularly necessary for dynamic analysis, since the nodal accelerations and velocities are defined in this section. In addition, the stresses and strains are defined as auxiliary variables to access the data later on to inspect the results. Following commands are the examples of defining the auxiliary variables:

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=AuxVariables end=Kernels

Using the above commands, user defines velocity, acceleration, stress, and strain auxiliary variables to be used later on to ask for an output. order = CONSTANT and family=MONOMIAL calculates the average stress within the element.

The above command blocks forms the basis for all quasi-static and dynamic analyses that can be conducted using MASTODON framework. Next section describes the Kernels related to physics involved in the particular analysis.

### Kernels

Kernels are related to the physics involved in the particular analysis. This document focusses on kernel commands related to the geotechnical earthquake engineering applications. Further information can be found on <a href= " http://mooseframework.org/wiki/MooseSystems/Kernels/"> Kernels </a>.

The main kernel that is used for quasi-static and dynamic analyses is <a href= " http://mooseframework.org/wiki/PhysicsModules/TensorMechanics/Dynamics/"> Dynamic Tensor Mechanics </a>  kernel. This kernel is used to solve the equation of motion without the inertial effects. It requires information about the unknowns that are solved for. The following chunk of commands can be used to activate dynamic tensor mechanics kernel along with Newmark-beta integration scheme, inertial effects, and two mode Rayleigh viscous damping (both stiffness and mass proportional damping):

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=Kernels end=BCs

displacements = 'disp_x disp_y disp_z' line is not necessary if the displacements are already defined as global parameters but are provided here for the sake of completeness. Beta and gamma are the parameters of Newmark-beta integration scheme. Zeta and eta are the stiffness and mass matrix coefficients of Rayleigh damping formulation (see <a href= " http://mooseframework.org/wiki/PhysicsModules/TensorMechanics/Dynamics/"> Dynamic Tensor Mechanics </a>  kernel and [Theory Manual](manuals/theory/index.md) for more information). Auxiliary kernels are specified to calculate the acceleration and velocities using Newmark-beta scheme at the end of each time step where the displacement is already solved and known. Lastly, stress_xy is defined as an auxiliary variable. This is achieved by specifying the type of the Auxkernel as RankTwoAux. RankTwoAux means that the source of the auxiliary variable is a rank two tensor, and the type of rank two tensor is explicitly defined as stress tensor using the command “rank_two_tensor = stress”. Since, the variable is stress_xy, the location in the stress tensor corresponding to stress_xy needs to be specified using index_i (row index) and index_j (column index). To request for stress_xy, index_i is set to 0 and index_j is set to 1. The next section explains the boundary conditions that are required to run a simple, quasi-static and dynamic analyses.

### Boundary Conditions

Boundary conditions are required by MASTODON finite element analysis framework to be able to run simple quasi-static and dynamic analysis. Herein, the basic boundary conditions are given and other constraints that are used to solve for geotechnical earthquake engineering problems are presented separately (e.g. periodic boundary conditions.) Following commands are related to the single element presented in \ref{fig:single_element} and a chunk of command is provided below to demonstrate how to fix the bottom nodes in all directions.

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=BCs end=Periodic

In the above code, type = PresetBC sets the variable = disp_”related degree of freedom” with the value = 0 which provides the fixity by defining a zero displacement at the node. boundary = 0 command selects the nodes at the bottom surface of the element (labeled as surface 0) and assigns the boundary conditions.

### Analysis Executioner

In order to unfold the analysis, executioner commands are required. There are two main types of executioner in MASTODON, which are steady and transient. Herein, an example is provided to run transient analysis that will be used later on examples related to geotechnical earthquake engineering applications.

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=Executioner end=Postprocessors

The type = Transient command is self-explanatory and sets the executioner type to transient. solve_type = PJFNK is the default option (preconditioned Jacobian Free Newton-Krylov) used to solve the transient problems in MASTODON without constructing full stiffness matrix. The command dt = 0.01 (is set to 0.01 sec. here for an example purpose) determines the initial time step and user is allowed to set a minimum time step “dtmin” for the analysis. start_time and end_time specifies where the transient analysis will start and where it will end. Further information on available options can be found in <a href= " http://mooseframework.org/wiki/MooseSystems/Executioners/"> Executioners </a> section of the MOOSE wiki webpage.

### Outputs

The analysis results can be dumped to a csv file using postprocessor and output commands. The first command should define the type of results that will be dumped into the csv file. The following command is an example to specify the results to be outputted:

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=Postprocessors

Since, the stresses, accelerations, and velocities are defined as an auxiliary variable previously ([Kernels](manuals/user/index.md)), they can be directly called in this section. elementid = 0 specifies the element  number  from which stress values will be pulled out. Note that MASTODON assigns numbers to elements and nodes different than those of the input file provided by the user (for user-defined mesh). To obtain the correct element and nodes numbers, the software Blot installed with MOOSE  or Paraview should be used. type = ElementVariableValue returns the average scalar stress value computed within the specified block. Finally, the results can be dumped into a csv file by using "Outputs command". Once the analysis is completed, the output csv file will be stored in the same folder as the input file. The first column contains the “Time”, and the rest of the columns contain the values asked in the "Postprocessors" command. Another form of output is the exodus file which can be read by Blot. The user also has the option to request results in both csv and exodus formats.

### Gravity Loading

Gravity loading can be applied on the domain to achieve the stress state due to gravity. MOOSE includes built-in commands to apply the gravity as a body force throughout the transient analysis. The following command can be used to apply the gravitational field on the modeled domain:

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=gravity end= AuxKernels

The above command should be embedded inside the [Kernels](manuals/user/index.md) command block. variable = disp_z activates the gravity in z direction and value = -9.81 is assigned to specify the magnitude and direction of the gravitational field.

Gravity command applies an external body force along the specified direction on the domain of interest. In order to bring the system to equilibrium, a transient analysis with some viscous damping is necessary. This approach causes fluctuations on the stress and strains at the beginning of the analysis because of the elements being initially at zero stress state. Viscous damping removes the fluctuations and brings the system to equilibrium. Once the system equilibrates, the gravity stresses are obtained along with the displacements due to the gravity loading. “Initial Stress” command is available in MASTODON framework to eliminate the need for a separate transient analysis. In addition, no displacements, or strains due to gravity result.

### Loads

There are two types of loads that can be applied to the domain of interest. These are prescribed displacement and prescribed loads. Both types can be defined as a time history.

#### Prescribed Displacement

The preset displacement boundary condition can be used to apply a displacement time history to a boundary (at the nodes). The displacement boundary condition first converts the user defined displacement time history to an acceleration time history using Backward Euler finite difference scheme. This acceleration is then integrated to get displacement using Newmark-beta method.  The resulting displacement is then applied as a kinematic displacement boundary condition. The following command can be used to apply the preset displacement boundary condition:

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=top_x end= Functions

The above command should be embedded inside the BCs command block. “boundary = 5” assigns the preset displacement to boundary 5 which, in this case, is a predefined boundary of a single element as described in \ref{fig:single_element}. Alternatively, the boundary number can be identified using <a href= "www.csimsoft.com/"> Trelis </a>.
“variable = disp_x” imposes the boundary condition on the x direction. “beta” is the Newmark-beta integration parameter. The “function = top_disp” specifies the function that defines the loading time history. It is defined in the “Functions” block as follows:

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=Functions end=Materials

Displacement2.csv is the file, located in the same directory of the input file, containing the displacement time history. The first column of this file should contain the time vector starting at 0.0. The second column should contain the displacement values. “type = PiecewiseLinear” defines the type of the function which is in this case piecewise-linear. “format” specifies the format of the data file, i.e. whether the data is in columns or rows.

#### Prescribed Acceleration

The preset acceleration boundary condition can be used to apply an acceleration time history to a boundary. The preset acceleration boundary condition integrates the given acceleration time history to get the displacement using Newmark-beta method. This displacement is then applied as a kinematic displacement boundary condition. Syntax is the same as prescribing a displacement boundary condition but with type = PresetAcceleration and the function describing time vs acceleration data instead of time vs displacement.

### Periodic Boundary Conditions

Periodic boundary conditions are used to constrain the nodes to move together in the specified directions. The following command is an example applied on the element presented in \ref{fig:single_element} and should be embedded into the BCs block segment as:

!listing test/tests/materials/I_soil/HYS_darendeli.i start=Periodic end=top_x

### Initial Stresses

Initial stress command is available to apply the prescribed initial stresses to the finite element domain. If the user applies initial stress state that is equal to that of gravity loadings, upon transient analysis, no vibration occurs and the domain reaches equilibrium with zero strains. This eliminates the necessity of conducting separate analysis for free-field problems and allows the user to start directly with a dynamic analysis such as base shaking etc. The following command can be used within the material definition to activate the initial stresses in the material block:


      initial_stress = '-4.204286 0 0  0 -4.204286 0  0 0 -9.810'

The nine numerical values fill the stress tensor in the following order - xx, xy, xz, yz, yy, yz, zx, zy, and zz. The above example command activates -4.2025 units of stress along both xx and yy direction, and -9.81 units of stress along zz direction.  These stresses are the gravity stresses at the mid-depth of the element in \ref{fig:single_element} with density = 2. Therefore, the element will immediately start with gravity stress conditions without any elastic deformations or stress fluctuations.

### Materials
#### Linear elastic soil
A linear elastic soil can be defined in MASTODON by defining a elasticity tensor using ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor, stress calculator using ComputeLinearElasticStress, and a small strain calculator using ComputeSmallStrain. Density can be defined using the GenericConstantMaterial. An example of these input blocks is shown below:

!listing test/tests/dirackernels/seismic_source/one_seismic_source.i start=Materials end=Executioner

#### I-soil material model
The nonlinear soil material model usage is demonstrated in the [Example 1] (/examples/index.md)
